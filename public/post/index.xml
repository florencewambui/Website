      <description>In the information age, we have access to almost every piece of information imaginable in a matter of seconds. However,at any given moment, we only need very specific and negligible portions. A good example is when we are reading/watching news,we are only interested in particular segments and particular details from those segments. For some it’s sports and within the sports category, some people will pick up information only on football matches whilst others on athletes.</description>

We all have our favourite foods. Some people can’t wait for their favourite fruit season andare willing to pay exorbitant amounts during the off season.</description>

Unsurprisingly, most of the top posters were recruitment agencies. Here are the recruitment and non-recruitment firms with highest number of posts:
In terms of number of jobs posted, Safaricom led the pack of non-recruitment organizations followed by Public Service Commission and Save the Children.A quick look at Safaricom posts shows that ICT/Engineering, Sales &amp;amp; Marketing, Administration, Finance/Accounting and Customer Care formed the bulk of its job posts.</description>
