                    Minimum Qualification: MastersExperience Level: Senior levelExperience Length: 10 years","International Labour OrganizationBetter Utilization of Skills for Youth through Quality Apprenticeship (BUSY project)TERMS OF REFERENCE (TOR)Consultancy service to develop a communication strategy - KEN/16/04/USADonor Agency:  United States Department of Labor (USDOL)Executing Agency: ILO Country Office for Tanzania, Kenya, UgandaImplementing agencies:  Governmental Agencies, Workers Organization, (COTU-K) and Employers’ Organizations (FKE)Geographical coverage:  Kilifi, Kitui and Busia counties in KenyaAssignment dates (indicative): May - June, 2019Contract Type: ILO – External Collaboration ContactProject overviewThe Better Utilization of Skills for Youth through Quality Apprenticeship (BUSY project) is a four year initiative being financed by the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL), and implemented by International Labour Organization (ILO) in partnership with the Ministry of Labour, the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) and the Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU-K). The overall project goal is to increase decent job opportunities and employability of young people, thereby addressing unemployment, vulnerability and poverty in urban and rural settings. The project’s objective is to improve the capacity of Kenyan government, employers’ and workers’ organizations, and civil society organizations to establish and expand workplace-based training programs with a focus on vulnerable and marginalized youth , in particular adolescents at or above the legal working age who are engaged in or at risk of engaging in child labor.The BUSY project is expected to achieve the following three long-term outcomes:Long-term outcome one: Laws or policies supporting quality workplace-based training opportunities for youth in Kenya, including vulnerable and marginalized youth, are improved and / or implemented by key stakeholders;   Long-term outcome two: Kenyan government, employers’ and workers’ organizations, and other stakeholders implement best practices related to workplace-based training for youth, including the most vulnerable and marginalized; and, Long-term outcome three: The quality of existing public and private programs in Kenya that provide vulnerable and marginalized youth with prerequisite skills to enter workplace-based training programs is improved.Under outcome two, the project is supporting the employers’ and workers’ organizations to enhance workplace-based training for youth onto their policy agendas in earnest, including for vulnerable and marginalized young women and men. The project supported two studies in target counties to gauge the levels of awareness and attitudes towards the implementation of workplace-based training programs for youth in employers’ and workers’ organizations, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized young men and women. The workers’ study focused on the demand side, and employers’ on the supply side. Both studies looked at formal and informal enterprises, and particular focus was given to small scale and semi-formal medium and small enterprises.The BUSY project is in the process of developing a communication strategy aimed at employers, Master Craftpersons, and the general public living in target counties to disseminate the study findings. In order to support interventions to address negative perceptions and knowledge gaps on workplace-based training amongst employers’ and workers’ organizations, training institutions, civil society and other stakeholders. The communication strategy and capacity building interventions and tools will be implemented via social dialogues platforms, workshops and through the use of targeted media activities. Background and context of  workplace-based training programs in KenyaYouth often obtain their training through the informal apprenticeship system, whereby they gain practical skills under the instruction of Master Craftspersons. In this sense, micro and small-sized enterprises operating in the informal economy provide easy access for a greater number of youth to receive skills training in both rural and urban settings. These are linked to labour market demand, allow school dropouts to enroll in vocational training schemes and are less costly for both beneficiaries’ households and government agencies. While informal apprenticeships provide the technical skills needed for paid employment, it is unclear if apprentices receive the skills they need to be successful at self-employment. From the findings of both the workers and employers studies, the quality of skills gained through informal apprenticeships vary substantively from one provider to the other due to lack of uniform training standards, variations in technology and facilities offered by the Master Crafts persons, lack of structure of training activities, differences regarding knowledge, skills and productivity of Master Crafts persons and lack of a mechanism / body that oversees / ensure the quality of training being provided. Likewise, trainees’ learning is not certified upon completion, impeding the recognition of their learning by third parties. This makes it difficult for youth to transition into employment in the formal sector. Informal apprentices are more vulnerable to exploitation (e.g. the risk of being used as cheap labor in small enterprises, or receiving incomplete knowledge that does not allow them to work efficiently in a trade) or decent work deficits such as poor working and/or OSH conditions, limited social protection, and their “training period” may in some cases be extended indefinitely or “continue” on the basis of poor pay.Rationale of the communication strategyThis communication strategic will provide direction for BUSY project external communication, in order to accurately reflect the main priorities of workers and employers to support BUSY project create awareness on WBT. The implementation of the strategy will be facilitated by BUSY project in cooperation with all the project partners. This strategy shall respond to the communication needs recommended in the PSA studies . Description of tasksBUSY project seeks a highly qualified communication expert to develop a communication strategy document to disseminate the pre- situation analysis studies conducted by workers and employers. The expectation is a well written plan that will detail how the PSA’s findings and recommendations will be communicated to employers, Master Craftpersons, and the general public in in Kilifi, Kitui and Busia. The strategy should use a systematic process and behavioral theory to design and implement communication activities that encourage awareness and change towards WBT for youth and MCPs. The communication strategy should include the following elements:Brief summary of the situation analysis Audience segmentationProgram theory to inform strategy developmentCommunication objectivesApproaches for achieving objectivesPositioning for the desired changeBenefits and messages to encourage desired changeCommunication channels to disseminate messages in line with number 5 of this ToRImplementation plan Monitoring and evaluation planBudgetsGender equality, diversity and inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized youth should be explicitly addressed throughout the communication strategy. The assignment is expected to take 20 working days and is expected to be carried out between May-June 2019.  Reporting ModalitiesThe Consultant will work under the overall guidance of the BUSY Project Director, with supervision by the Workplace Based Training Specialist. Qualification and Education ExperienceThe Consultant should have an advanced University degree in Communications studies or other relevant fields.The consultant should also have at least 10 year experience in carrying out similar assignments.The consultant should have the following competencies:-Excellent communication and interpersonal skills; Excellent English writing skills; andAbility to work independently.Evaluation Criteria  The selection of the consultant will be based on :Responsive technical proposal; andHaving received the highest score at qualification and experience.Incomplete application and applications received after the deadline will not be considered.

REACH’s purpose
 is to promote and facilitate the development of information products 
that enhance the humanitarian community’s decision making and planning 
capacity for emergency, reconstruction and development contexts. REACH 
facilitates information management for aid actors through three 
complementary services: (a) need and situation assessments facilitated 
by REACH teams; (b) situation analysis using satellite imagery; (c) 
provision of related database and (web)-mapping facilities and 
expertise.IMPACT Initiatives is a humanitarian NGO, based in Geneva, 
Switzerland. The organisation manages several initiatives, including the
 REACH Initiative. The IMPACT team comprises specialists in data 
collection, management and analysis and GIS. IMPACT was launched at the 
initiative of ACTED, an international NGO whose headquarter is based in 
Paris and is present in thirty countries. The two organizations have a 
strong complementarity formalized in a global partnership, enabling 
IMPACT to benefit from ACTED’s operational support on its fields of 
intervention.We are currently looking for a REACH Assessment Officer to support our REACH team in South Sudan.Department: REACHPosition: REACH Assessment OfficerContract duration: 6 monthsLocation: Juba, South Sudan, with frequent travel to field locationsStarting Date: ASAPCOUNTRY PROFILEIMPACT, through its own activities, or through REACH, has been 
implementing programming in South Sudan since 2012. Responding to the 
Sudan Border Crisis, REACH initially engaged through coordinated 
information management support – in the form of refugee camp mapping and
 service provision analyses, thematic assessments, and multi-sectorial 
needs assessments – in Maban County, Upper Nile State and Pariang 
County, Unity State. IMPACT was engaged by DFID to provide a series of 
impact evaluations of their BRACE programming across Greater Bahr el 
Ghazal and Upper Nile States in 2013; a programme with run for two 
years, included 5 total assessments, and touched a total of more than 
20,000 households. Immediately following the conflict of December 2013, 
REACH expanded its programming to include the IDP response, 
participating in Initial Rapid Needs Assessments of conflict affected 
areas, providing mapping and monthly service provision analyses for 
major IDP sites around the country, and running large-scale IDP return 
intentions assessments.2018 has seen the expansions of both IMPACT and REACH programming to 
10 out of 10 states, spanning the refugee, IDP and development 
responses, and covering diverse activities such as cross-border port 
monitoring, assessments of hard to reach areas, flood mapping and 
vulnerability analysis, market monitoring and supply chain analysis, 
analysis of tensions and conflicts over access to natural resources, and
 third party monitoring of humanitarian and development programming.The project:This project, “Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) in South 
Sudan,” seeks to inform the South Sudan humanitarian response on 
community perceptions of service delivery in order to enable a more 
community-centred and responsive approach. The REACH Assessment Officer 
(AAP) will be responsible for the design of quantitative and qualitative
 tools that will capture the prevalence of perceptions of 1) awareness 
of humanitarian service delivery 2) relevance of interventions and 
targeting models 3) fairness of service delivery and 4) respect of 
beneficiaries during service delivery. The project will involve field 
research that will rely heavily on REACH’s Area of Knowledge 
methodology. As such, data will be collected remotely from areas inside 
South Sudan where access to direct regular primary data collection is 
not possible, as well as through direct primary data collection in 
secure and accessible locations. The REACH Assessment Officer (AAP) will
 be in charge of producing quarterly factsheets summarizing the 
quantitative data collected through the various rounds of data 
collection and to produce a longer report that will incorporate 
quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Successful completion of 
this project will require short but frequent visits to field and 
deep-field locations, as well as collaboration with local, national and 
international partners, and constant coordination with the Community 
Engagement Working Group and the various Clusters.POSITION PROFILEREACH is seeking to fill a position for an Assessment Officer

REACH’s purpose
 is to promote and facilitate the development of information products 
that enhance the humanitarian community’s decision making and planning 
capacity for emergency, reconstruction and development contexts. REACH 
facilitates information management for aid actors through three 
complementary services: (a) need and situation assessments facilitated 
by REACH teams; (b) situation analysis using satellite imagery; (c) 
provision of related database and (web)-mapping facilities and 
expertise.IMPACT Initiatives is a humanitarian NGO, based in Geneva, 
Switzerland. The organisation manages several initiatives, including the
 REACH Initiative. The IMPACT team comprises specialists in data 
collection, management and analysis and GIS. IMPACT was launched at the 
initiative of ACTED, an international NGO whose headquarter is based in 
Paris and is present in thirty countries. The two organizations have a 
strong complementarity formalized in a global partnership, enabling 
IMPACT to benefit from ACTED’s operational support on its fields of 
intervention.We are currently looking for a REACH Web-GIS Officer to support our REACH team in South Sudan.Department: REACHPosition: REACH Web-GIS OfficerContract duration: 6 monthsLocation: Juba, South SudanStarting Date: ASAPCOUNTRY PROFILEIMPACT, through its own activities, or through REACH, has been

needs assessments – in Maban County, Upper Nile State and Pariang 
County, Unity State. IMPACT was engaged by DFID to provide a series of 
impact evaluations of their BRACE programming across Greater Bahr el 
Ghazal and Upper Nile States in 2013; a programme with run for two 
years, included 5 total assessments, and touched a total of more than 
20,000 households. Immediately following the conflict of December 2013, 
REACH expanded its programming to include the IDP response, 
participating in Initial Rapid Needs Assessments of conflict affected 
areas, providing mapping and monthly service provision analyses for 
major IDP sites around the country, and running large-scale IDP return 
intentions assessments.2018 has seen the expansions of both IMPACT and REACH programming to 
10 out of 10 states, spanning the refugee, IDP and development 
responses, and covering diverse activities such as cross-border port 
monitoring, assessments of hard to reach areas, flood mapping and 
vulnerability analysis, market monitoring and supply chain analysis,

world leader in scaling evidence-based and cost-effective programs to 
reduce the burden of poverty for hundreds of millions of people in the 
poorest places. Our two flagship at-scale programs, Deworm the World and
 Dispensers for Safe Water, reached over 280 million people last year 
and have been named “top” and “standout” charities respectively by 
GiveWell in 2018, with Deworm the World being named a top charity for 
the sixth year in a row.In addition to running these scaled 
programs, Evidence Action also leverages its unique Beta incubator to 
explore what interventions with initial evidence of impact might be 
suitable for massive scale up to become our next flagship programs.Evidence Action partners with a diverse
 set of governments and non-government organizations, providing 
long-term, focused support on the scale-up of specific evidence-based 
interventions. Currently, in Africa Region, we partner closely with 
governments at the national and/or sub-national levels in several 
countries - Kenya, Malawi, Ethiopia, Uganda and Nigeria - and have 
supported a partnership with the Government of Botswana. Some of our 
current government partnerships include:Deworming: In Kenya, Nigeria 
and Ethiopia, we support national governments to implement school-based 
deworming programs, annually treating children at risk for soil 
transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis. We also support the 
Government of Kenya to treat for Lymphatic Filariasis in endemic areas.Teaching at the right level: Since
 2014, we have partnered with the Government of Kenya to design and 
support the implementation of its national youth service initiative, 
known as G-United. G-United program recruits recent university graduates
 as volunteers to support struggling primary school children using the 
evidence-backed Teaching at the Right Level approach.Safe Water: In Malawi, we 
partner with the Ministry of Health to implement Dispensers for Safe 
Water, reaching over 620,000 Malawians with sustained access to clean 
water and sustaining take-up rate of 70%+. We are also keen to further deepen our
 government involvement in our Dispenser for Safe Water programs for 
Kenya and Uganda, so as to continue to sustainably provide safe water to
 3.4+ million Kenyans and Ugandans. Additionally, Evidence Action
 works with other non-government organizations. We have such active 
partnerships in Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Uganda and we are keen to

Job Description (Roles and Responsibilities)
             
      This is an exciting opportunity to set up and lead a new, innovative 
and high-profile Tech Hub in Kenya that will aim to develop the Kenyan 
tech ecosystem, deliver digital skills programmes, and build links 
between Kenyan and international (including UK) tech businesses. We are 
looking for a dynamic, well-networked leader from the Kenya tech scene 
for this important role, who will use their significant experience and 
network to shape and lead this exciting initiative. The hub will be one 
of four critical pillars of a new Prosperity Fund programme to drive 
greater digital access in countries like Kenya.  New and innovative, the
 Prosperity Fund (PF) represents a step change in HMG’s approach to 
promoting economic development and prosperity overseas.The PF was
 established under the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR)
 with the primary aim of supporting growth in recipient countries and 
thereby reducing poverty. As such, it represents a key component of the 
prosperity pillar of the UK Aid Strategy. But the Fund uniquely focuses 
on promoting growth in ODA-eligible middle income countries, which are 
home to nearly 70% of the world’s poor and where the development 
challenges remain significant, but at the same time are important 
business partners and drivers of prosperity. By delivering high impact, 
strategic multi-year programmes, across high opportunity countries, 
regions and sectors, the Fund will help create opportunities for 
international business, including UK companies. As the UK leaves the EU,
 an even more outward-looking global Britain investing and trading with 
the fastest growing markets will become increasingly important.The
 role will be based in Nairobi, with some travel across the country 
which will be required to maximise the success and outputs of the hub 
across Kenya. There will also be some overseas travel, including to the 
UK.The UK- Kenya Tech Hub will be one of the first in a global 
network of international tech partnerships developed by the UK 
government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to 
build digital ecosystems that will facilitate sustainable economic 
growth and development.The successful candidate will lead a small
 team of locally-engaged staff, based within the British High 
Commission, and will be responsible for shaping and delivering the 
strategy for the Hub. The team will support local digital ecosystems in 
both the commercial hotspots and across more disadvantaged regions of 
the partner country. They follow the example of successful hubs 
elsewhere in the world such as the UK-Israel Hub in Tel Aviv. The Tech 
Hub Network is funded as part of a cross-government, Prosperity-funded 
programme, so collaboration across departments will be a critical 
success factor in this role.The Hub will have three main aims:●      deliver tailored interventions to cultivate digital skills
 responding to the needs and opportunities for inclusion in the local 
tech sector for example promoting opportunities for youth and women in 
the local tech sector; ●      support tech entrepreneurship
 through partnerships with local digital ecosystem stakeholders 
including incubators, accelerators, UK and SA private sector firms, SA 
government departments and agencies and non-profit organisations ●      facilitate partnerships
 between local tech firms (including tech startups) and international 
companies (across all sectors) in the form of commercial partnerships or
 joint venturesRoles and responsibilities / what will the jobholder be expected to achieve?:The
 successful applicant will design the strategy for, and establish the 
Kenya Tech Hub and will work with colleagues at DCMS and other 
departments working in digital access to set the Hub’s overall direction

operations across Kenya, leading on cross departmental projects and 
developing and maintaining senior relationships with both internal and 
external contacts and sponsors developing a public and media profile for
 the Hub’s activities, leading on reporting and working as part of the 
High Commissioner's team and mission.Responsibilities will include:-      
 Overall leadership of the Tech Hub, including leading a team of 
locally-engaged staff, managing the Hub budget and ensuring that Hub 
operations run smoothly;-       Leading the formulation of a 
strategy for the country, building on the Kenyan context and aligning to
 broader Prosperity Fund objectives;-       Working closely with 
DCMS central Tech Hub team, Digital Access Programme Adviser, and other 
UK government departments, including the Department for International 
Trade (DIT), DFID and FCO to ensure that strategic priorities are 
aligned;-       Acting as the figurehead and lead point of 
contact for the Hub for stakeholders in government, (both Kenyan and UK)
 corporates and startups;-       Collaborating with the other Hubs in the global network to develop the network offering;-

                    Minimum Qualification: BachelorExperience Level: Senior levelExperience Length: 5 years","Background/IRC Summary:  The International Rescue Committee is among the world’s leading humanitarian relief and development organizations. The IRC has been at the forefront of virtually every major humanitarian initiative to assist people uprooted by war, persecution, or civil conflict for the last 80 years. And, more than 80 years after Albert Einstein helped create the IRC, the number and intensity of humanitarian crises across the globe warrant a dose of Einstein-inspired innovation. The world’s more than 50 million displaced people, the most since World War II, require more than “aid as usual.” Their growing and increasingly complex needs mandate a transformation—a creative rethinking—in the global humanitarian response. The beneficiaries of its programs deserve evidence-based interventions that bring real change to their lives. That is what the IRC is determined to deliver. The IRC has grown because its teams have gone to the toughest places, done cutting-edge research, developed in-depth knowledge, and forged vital relationships with local governments. Today its 11,000 employees and 13,000 incentive workers work in 170 field offices in 40 crisis-torn countries are helping communities rebuild after Ebola, survive terrorist insurgencies, and recover from war. From health care to education to protection for women and girls, the IRC is there. And unlike any other humanitarian organization, it is also in 26 U.S. cities, helping newly arrived refugees adjust to life in America and make a contribution to their new country. Major Responsibilities:Provide support to the Ethics and Compliance Unit (“ECU”) in conducting investigations of specific cases originating from West Africa & the Great Lakes region, including  field sites, and camp locations. Perform key investigative procedures for assigned cases as directed, including, but not limited to: • Undertake investigations of alleged fraud, waste, financial corruption, misconduct, ensuring objectivity, impartiality and fairness throughout investigative processes in accordance with generally recognized international investigative standards and IRC guidelines and ECU policies and procedures;• Development of investigative work plans; review and analyze information to determine its relevance and reliability, conduct interviews of staff and other involved parties, record interviews, obtain and analyze potential documentary and electronic evidence, conduct investigative research, prepare draft investigation reports, and present investigative results in a clear written form;• Preparation of investigative report drafts. • Preparing informational requests, overseeing document collections, and conducting review of documents; • Research of individuals, corporations, and other topics; Prepare reports and ad hoc briefs pertaining to investigations in coordination with the Sr. Director, Investigations • Electronic evidence review, such as email and data; • Interviews with IRC staff, vendors, and other third parties; • Status reporting; Working Relationships: Consultancy Reports to:  Sr. Investigator, Investigations, NairobiConsultancy directly supervises:  NoneOther Internal and/or external contactsInternal: Headquarters departments, international and U.S. program operations as neededExternal:  Vendors, service providers and external auditors and contractors as neededJOB REQUIREMENTS Education: Bachelor’s degree required in business, accounting, criminal justice or related field.Certificates, licenses or advanced degrees in law, accounting or computer forensics an advantage: (CFE/CFF/CPA/CA/CCEP) Work Experience:• 5+ years of international financial fraud investigations (procurement, vendor/supply chain) experience (including substantive experience in developing countries and insecure environments) • Excellent judgment and discretion• Experience conducting fraud, collusion, bribery and corruption investigations in challenging environments, and in the locations where the IRC operates;• Experience leading investigations of complex fraud, collusion and procurement fraud in government programs, NGO programs or the equivalent;• Experience working with investigation teams in distant locations and insecure environments;• Experience conducting interviews of witnesses and subjects;• Experience with international organizations and nonprofits, NGO sectors or grant-supported organizations, or the inspector general function within a large government organization.• Experience of investigating sexual exploitation a plus.Travel to insecure environments requiredDemonstrated Skills and Competencies:• Fluency in French is a requirement• Fraud Investigation Principles and Techniques, including Procurement Fraud, Bribery, Collusion and Corruption • Extensive Interviewing skills and the ability to interview both witnesses and subjects• Experience with computer and accounting forensic specialists (having such expertise a plus)• Communications – Written and Oral English• Demonstrated ability to build relationships and work successfully with internal functional units and operations• Ability to work well within a team environment and adhere to reporting structures• Excellent writing and report drafting skills• MS Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint and VISIO• Demonstrated experience and a successful track record working with minimal supervision and with flexibility.Working Environment: • Consultancy is based in Nairobi, Kenya with a standard office work environment• Travel 50% or more to developing countries including insecure environments "
