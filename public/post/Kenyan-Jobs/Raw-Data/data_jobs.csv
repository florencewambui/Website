Structuring One Acre Fund impact data for enhanced uses: Our M&E and R&D departments currently collect and manage large quantities of valuable farmer data. The Impact Data Engineer will act as the unifying force across teams and countries to harmonize current impact-related data sets to enable more efficient meta analyses and strategic decision making.

Building efficient data management tools: In addition to structuring existing data, the Impact Data Engineer will work with field data collection teams to ensure that new data collected integrates with the central system seamlessly. The Data Engineer will influence the entire data collection chain from the farmer to the decision making process.

Expanding and maintaining R API to Impact data system: One Acre Fund uses a system called CommCare to build and deploy surveys with field enumerator teams. We have a working API to simplify accessing data from the CommCare system for analysis. The Impact<U+00A0>Data Engineer will be responsible for expanding the capacity and usability of the API and chart a course for integrating its use into One Acre Fund analytics.

Identify and advise on opportunities for data systems improvement: At One Acre Fund, we believe in continual growth for the organization as well as individuals. Our data systems are no exception. The Impact Data Engineer will spend time understanding data systems pain points across the organization, prioritize potential improvement projects, and then work with the relevant stakeholders to build a solution. These projects could range from identifying a more efficient way to data-enter paper contracts to working with our soil lab to digitize their sample tracking process in a way that can ultimately integrate into our broader data ecosystem.

Providing technical support as needed: We have a growing roster of software developers and data analysts who sit in different teams across One Acre Fund. The Impact Data Engineer will join this group, facilitating knowledge exchange across teams.

","

Optimizing for impact: We know that people with the data engineering skill set are highly sought after and could easily find a job in the corporate world with a large salary. Our compensation package affords a comfortable quality of life but is modest in comparison.

Strong work experiences: Previous experience as a Data Engineer, building pipelines across different data platforms with the users in mind. We are looking for someone who sees data, people, and business insights as inextricably linked and enjoys working with different teams to understand their needs as much as devising data infrastructure solutions (both software and hardware).



Technical skills:



Previous experience with SQL, SSAS, or SSIS platforms for data warehousing solutions.

Proficient in T-SQL or similar program.<U+00A0>

Experience with MDX is a plus.

Familiarity with R.

Experience designing tables and picking datatypes.

Experience with Performance Tuning and Optimization (PTO), using native SQL Server monitoring and troubleshooting tools.

Prefer Candidates with Bachelors in Computer Science, Engineering, MIS, or related discipline.



Professional skills:



Very strong self-manager. We want someone who is organized and comfortable independently leading projects while working closely with other teams.

Able to see the forest and the trees. We are looking for someone who can keep the big picture in mind, and is also willing and able to roll up her/his sleeves and dig in and find solutions.





Outstanding responsiveness to feedback:<U+00A0>We firmly believe that ability to act on both reinforcing and redirecting feedback is the fastest way to grow. Individuals with a growth mindset will thrive in our team culture.

A willingness to commit to at least two years: This is a long-term, career<U+0096>track role. The ideal candidate will have had experience working in an emerging market, although this is not required.

Language: English required; working proficiency in Swahili and/or French is a bonus.
